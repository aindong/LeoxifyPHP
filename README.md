----------- About ------------

- This is a PHP MVC(Model - View - Controller) Framework that is easy to use and lightweight.

- MVC Framework out there like CakePHP, Yii, CodeIgniter and Zend and so many many more
- I want to learn more about php and how mvc work so I decided to work on this project in order
- to improve my skills in object oriented programming and understanding in MVC.

- to create things. :)
